    <h1>Human mission to Mars</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction <b>since the 1880</b>, and aerospace engineering and scientific proposals since the late 1940. Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of the planet</p>

    <h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>
    <p>the exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Conceptial work for mission that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <b>the 1950s</b>, with planeed mission typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from time they are drafted. The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows the various mission propals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few week or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. though reserch station, colonization or other continuous humanization).[crition need] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, have also been proposed.In the 2010s, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human missions tto Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. </p>
